**Executive Summary**

This analysis investigates how Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear vs Greed) influences trader behavior and profitability on Hyperliquid.

After aligning trade-level data with daily sentiment classification, we engineered behavioral metrics including daily PnL, win rate, leverage exposure, trade frequency, and long/short bias.

We observe that:

- Traders increase leverage and trade frequency during Greed days.

- Profitability variance is significantly higher during Fear days.

- High-leverage traders experience disproportionately large drawdowns in negative sentiment regimes.

- Consistent traders outperform volatile traders regardless of sentiment.

- Based on these findings, we propose sentiment-aware risk adjustment strategies, including leverage reduction during Fear periods and selective risk expansion for consistent traders during Greed phases.
